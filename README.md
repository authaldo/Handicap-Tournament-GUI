# Handicap Tournament GUI

Minimalistic GUI for organizing the handicap tournaments played within my table tennis club.
Inspired by the monthly handicap tournaments at [PT Espoo](http://www.ptespoo.net/) in Finland.
Before developing this GUI version, we have been using an adapted version of [ttSchweizer](https://github.com/tgfuellner/ttSchweizer).
Built as an android app using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).
